        <h2>Recorder Playing Robot</h2>
        <p>I'm building a robot that plays the recorder. I'm pretty bogged down in school right now, so this isn't my highest priority, but I really am passionate about it. All of the code is done and on <a href="https://github.com/cweeks12/robo-corder">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h2>BYU Mars Rover</h2>
        <p>I'm also on the Mars Rover team for my Senior Capstone project. This involves a lot of Python work. I'm on the embedded programming team, and the head of the GUI design team.</p>

        <h2>Soapmaking for Peru</h2>
        <p>I know that this doesn't have anything to do with programming, but it's a project. We're creating a process for making soap for them to sell to tourists. This has gotten me into a bunch of Chemical Engineering concepts.</p>
